# Stream: Assets (AI-generated 3D models into the game)

> Read [../workstreams.md](../workstreams.md) and [look_and_feel.md](look_and_feel.md).
> You own `assets/`, `tools/assets/`, `mk/assets.mk` (new), and `game/theme/<theme>/generated/`.
> Coordinate art direction (prompts, style) with look & feel; they own which scene fills a slot.

## Goal

A repeatable path from "prompt an AI 3D generator" to "a model sitting correctly in a visual slot,
fast enough for phones and the web".

## Services to evaluate (verify current offerings, pricing, API access, and license terms first)

Text- and image-to-3D generators such as Meshy, Tripo, Rodin (Hyper3D), and Luma, plus open models
(e.g. Stable Fast 3D, TRELLIS) that can run locally. Criteria: glTF/GLB export, API automation,
texture quality, polygon control/remeshing, **commercial-use license for generated output**, cost.
API keys live in environment variables, never in the repo.

## Pipeline to build

```
prompt / reference image ─▶ service ─▶ assets/incoming/<name>.glb   (raw; not committed if large)
   ─▶ tools/assets/normalize   scale to the slot's size, forward = −Z, origin at the slot's anchor,
                               decimate to the triangle budget, textures ≤ 1024², materials the
                               Compatibility renderer supports
   ─▶ tools/assets/check       budgets + orientation + bounds report (make assets-check)
   ─▶ game/theme/<theme>/generated/<slot>.glb + a wrapper .tscn implementing the slot's methods
   ─▶ GameTheme slot points at the wrapper (look & feel's call)
```

Godot imports glTF natively; commit `.import` files. Prefer git LFS (or committing only
optimized GLBs) for binaries.

## Slot contracts

All: units are meters, **forward is −Z**, up is +Y, and origin as stated. Visuals must not add collision.

| Slot | Anchor / origin | Size guide (matches gameplay collision) | Optional methods | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tank.hull` | ground contact, center of the hull | 2.4 wide × 3.6 long × ≤ 1.6 tall (turret ring at y ≈ 1.22, z ≈ +0.2) | `set_team_color(Color)` | ≤ 8k tris |
| `tank.turret` | turret pivot (rotates about +Y) | ~1.4 × 1.7 × 0.55 | `set_team_color` | ≤ 4k tris |
| `weapon.cannon` | turret pivot; barrel along −Z | muzzle ~3.2 m ahead of the pivot (gameplay fires from there) | `set_team_color`, `setup(weapon)` | ≤ 2k tris |
| `weapon.flamethrower` | turret pivot; nozzle along −Z | short; show a flame effect ~20 m long | `set_team_color`, `setup(weapon)`, `set_firing(bool)` | ≤ 2k tris + FX |
| `prop.crate` | ground center | 4.5 × 3 × 4.5 | — | ≤ 2k tris |
| `prop.wall` | ground center | 18 long (X) × 3 tall × 1.5 thick | — | ≤ 3k tris |
| `weapon.laser` *(planned, gameplay G7)* | turret pivot; emitter along −Z | like the cannon | `set_team_color`, `setup(weapon)`, `set_firing(bool)`, `set_heat(ratio)` | ≤ 2k tris |
| `fx.shell` *(planned, gameplay G7)* | projectile center, flying along −Z | ~0.3 × 0.3 × 1 | — (tracer + light, pooled) | ≤ 200 tris |
| `fx.laser_beam` *(planned, gameplay G7)* | muzzle | stretched to the hit point | `setup(from: Vector3, to: Vector3)` | FX only |
| `arena.environment` | world origin | sky/lighting/fog only | — | — |
| `arena.dressing` | world origin | ground 320×320 at y=0; perimeter walls at ±121 | — | ≤ 50k tris |

Style for everything generated: the cyberpunk gladiator arena (look_and_feel.md). Dark, weathered
scrap and metal **with emissive maps** for neon strips, lights, and signage, since lighting is the
game's headline look. Emissive textures must survive normalization and import.

## First milestone

One generated tank hull (and turret) rendering in a test theme at the right size and orientation,
`make assets-check` enforcing the table above, and the determinism hash unchanged.

## Status

- 2026-09-13: brief and slot contracts written. Nothing started.
