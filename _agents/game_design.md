## The game in one paragraph

A **die-hard real-time squad tactics game** in a Death Race gladiator arena. Before each round you **spend a
budget on fixed unit types**: over-the-top converted war machines like the armored prison-bus dozer. You split
them into **up to 5 squads** and command **one squad at a time** with taps: pick a squad, tap where it goes.
Every vehicle is **smart on its own**. It uses cover, peeks out to shoot, picks targets its weapon is good
against, and avoids shooting its friends, because **friendly fire is real**. You win by combining units that
cover each other's weaknesses, like StarCraft's rock-paper-scissors, and by commanding squads better than your
opponent. Winning earns **credits** that unlock more unit types and bigger budgets.

## Pillars (use these to settle design arguments)

1. **For die-hard players.** Depth over dopamine. No pay-to-win, no premium currency, no shortcuts for sale,
   no ads, no energy timers **(lead)**. Progress comes only from playing well. The web version is free; the Android
   app is a paid app **(lead, intent)**.
2. **Over-the-top eccentric vehicles.** The lead: *"What made Mad Max and Death Race so good was the over-the-top
   eccentric vehicles. This makes it go from a nerdy army game to a fun game"* (in the spirit of the Metal Gear
   Solid era). Every unit is a character with a silhouette you remember ([art_direction.md](art_direction.md)).
3. **Simple units, deep combinations.** Units are **static** during a match: no upgrades, no weapon swaps
   **(lead)**. Depth comes from matchups, positioning, and squad coordination, not from menus.
4. **Smart autonomous units.** Even before any LLM, every vehicle behaves like a competent crew. The player
   decides *where* and *what*; units handle *how* **(lead)**.
5. **Mobile first.** Everything works with single taps, drags, and pinches on a phone. No right-click, no
   hover, no keyboard required **(lead)**.
6. **Readable at a glance.** You can always tell whose unit it is, what type it is, and where your squads are
   going, even in the dark neon arena.

## Units: fixed types that counter each other

Each unit type is a fixed package: chassis, one weapon, armor, speed, sight, cost. **No loadouts.**
Round 1's weapons don't disappear; they move onto unit types (the lead: *"the laser is awesome, but we'll
just move that to a different unit type"*).

### Starting roster (proposed; the lead named the scout, tank, and IFV)

| Unit | Real-world idea | Weapon and mount | Strong against | Weak against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scout** | armored rally truck / dune buggy | **fixed forward machine gun, no turret**: it only hits what it points at **(lead)** | artillery, lasers (fast, gets close, hard to track) | IFVs (fast turret, autocannon shreds light armor) |
| **Tank** | the prison-bus dozer (in the game now) | heavy cannon on a **slow turret** **(lead)** | IFVs, anything heavy that sits still | scouts (the turret can't track them), massed IFVs flanking |
| **IFV** (Bradley / Stryker) | armored bus or garbage truck | **30 mm autocannon**: fast fire, low penetration, **fast turret** **(lead)** | scouts and light units | tanks (can't get through front armor) |
| **Artillery** | crane carrier with a mortar battery | indirect arcing fire, minimum range, needs a teammate's sight | slow clumps, units holding still | scouts, anything that closes the distance |
| **Lancer** (laser) | converted power-utility truck | long hitscan beam, **heat-limited**, strips shields | tanks at range, shielded targets | scouts, IFV rushes |

The flamethrower becomes a candidate future unit (a close-range "Burner"). Future units are added one at a
time, each with a clear job and a clear counter.

**Rules that make matchups real** (proposed, rules stream): turret turn rate vs target angular speed decides
tracking; penetration vs armor facing decides whether a hit hurts; fixed-mount weapons only fire inside a narrow
forward arc; scouts' speed beats slow turrets; artillery's minimum range punishes being rushed. Matchups must
emerge from these mechanics rather than a damage multiplier table, and be **measured** with the match runner
(a unit-vs-unit matrix in balance.md).

**Keep from round 1:** Halo-style recharging shields over hull health (the lead chose them), finite ammo with
base resupply (rules stream may simplify if it doesn't add decisions), heat only where a unit's weapon uses
it (the Lancer). **Drop:** components, heat sinks, ammo racks, per-hardpoint weapons.

## Factions (lead, 2026-09-15)

The lead: *"So I think we're settled on the idea for factions. We want them, and we'll make them wildly different
characteristics. We will figure out over time how to balance the factions."* Not scheduled yet: round 2 builds one
roster (today's vehicles become the Condemned).

**Principles**
- **Same roles, wildly different trade-offs.** Every faction fills the same five roles (scout, tank, IFV, artillery,
  special), so counters stay learnable, but each role plays differently per faction. The lead's example: the gang's
  tank-class vehicle is a converted fuel truck whose back is a giant war machine, in the spirit of Death Race's
  Dreadnought, not a dozer with different numbers.
- **One shared mechanics vocabulary.** Mechanics are built once in rules (shields, field repair, turning circle vs
  pivot steering, pinning harpoons, burning ground, energy vs ammo, …) and a faction's identity is the combination
  it gets. The AI learns each mechanic once, so faction count doesn't multiply AI work.
- **Counters live between units, not factions** (lead, 2026-09-15: *"I was talking rock paper scissors across
  units. The gang shouldn't inherently be weaker than the syndicate"*). Every faction must have an answer to every
  enemy unit type, so any faction pair is near 50/50 when both sides build good armies. A mechanic that is strong
  against one faction's units (knockback vs light hover units, hover vs ground hazards) is balanced by that faction
  having other units that answer it, and scales with unit properties (knockback by mass), never with the faction.
  **Measure both levels:** the unit matrix shows clear counters; faction vs faction, each with its best searched
  army, lands near 50%. Where it doesn't, add or tune a unit-level answer.
- **Locomotion is part of the vocabulary:** treads pivot in place (Condemned), articulated trucks and wheels turn
  wide but run fast (road gangs), heavy wheels are quick and controlled (the Law), hover strafes and drifts on
  momentum (the Syndicate). Factions read apart by how they move.
- **A faction is a choice, never more power** (pillar 1). Unlocking one, if ever, is a sidegrade.
- **Balance over time** with headless simulation: the matchup matrix across factions, plus a search for dominant
  armies ([determinism.md](determinism.md) keeps runs reproducible). Playtests judge feel and exploits.
- **Our own names and designs.** Mad Max, Death Race, and Judge Dredd set the vibe; no copied vehicles or names.
- **People are visible, violence isn't graphic** (proposed): riders and crews on vehicles, **crews bail out** when a
  vehicle dies, riders are thrown clear as damage builds, no blood or gore. Target around ESRB Teen / PEGI 12 (the
  Google Play IARC questionnaire decides). Explosions, fire, and scrap carry the spectacle.
- **Readability:** faction lighting (Law strobes, Syndicate cyan) must never be confused with team accent colors.

**The four factions (working names and first ideas)**

| Faction | Who | Look | Trade-offs | Signature ideas |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The Condemned** | Convicts fighting for freedom; the crowd pities them | Prison dozers, armored buses, garbage trucks: tall, boxy, welded shut, hazard paint, cage mesh | Tough, cheap, holds ground; slow | Today's roster: treads that pivot, shields |
| **Road gangs** (the Wreckers / Scrapborn / Chrome Cult) | Wasteland raiders; the crowd favorite | Low, open hot rods and buggies on huge tires; chrome, rust, spikes, fire; visible crews | **No shields**; fast, cheap, deadly up close, fragile; wheels with turning circles | Field repairs by crews; explosive spears (high penetration, short range); harpoon ballista that pins; catapult of flaming barrels leaving burning ground |
| **The Law** | The state's wardens, the house team the crowd boos; the **baseline faction**, easiest to learn (closest to the lead's original sci-fi army vision) | Militarized cyberpunk police, **professional but worn down** (a failing state): MRAPs, up-armored cruisers, 8×8 assault guns; red and blue strobes, spotlight towers, holo POLICE projections; one exaggerated feature per vehicle | Reliable, moderate damage, heavy wheels | Information and control: reveal, spotting, tear gas and smoke that cut sight and accuracy, knockback scaled by target mass |
| **The Syndicate / "the Sponsors"** | The corporation that owns the show; every match is a product demo | **Curvy sci-fi hover vehicles** (the lead: like Halo's Wraith, but human corporate luxury, our own designs): **ivory tower**: immaculate glossy ivory or black shells, cyan light lines, sponsor logos, hover glow lighting the floor, unmanned | Few, very expensive, strong at range; hover drifts and has lighter armor | Energy (heat and shields) instead of ammo; railgun; lasers (the Lancer); spotter-guided missiles; a shield projector; optical camo |

**Road gang roster sketch:** scout = spear buggy; IFV = hot-rod pickup with twin salvaged machine guns and spear
riders; **tank = the fuel-truck war rig** (lots of scrap hit points, fast in a straight line, wide turning circle,
rams, harpoon ballista, spear riders; weak when flanked while turning); artillery = catapult truck; special =
war-drum truck that rallies nearby units, or a resupply tanker. Idea pool: hub blades that damage what they pass,
a wrecking-ball crane, caltrops or oil slicks, nitro bursts.

**The Law roster sketch:** scout = up-armored pursuit cruiser (ram bar, giant light bar, hood gun, siren pulse that
briefly reveals hidden units); IFV = Cougar-style 6×6 MRAP with a remote autocannon turret; **tank = 8×8 wheeled
assault gun** (Stryker-style: big cannon, faster than the dozer, less armor, longer sight); artillery = truck rocket
launcher firing tear gas and smoke; special = riot truck with water cannon or sonic emitter (knockback).

**Syndicate roster sketch:** scout = hover skimmer drone with optical camo; IFV = hover gunship with a heat-limited
pulse cannon; **tank = curvy hover battle tank with a charge-up railgun** (the conventional tank role, made sci-fi);
artillery = missile platform that fires only at spotted targets; special = shield projector or the Lancer laser
(decide with the full roster).

**How each faction looks: a wear spectrum** (the lead, 2026-09-15: *"The Law should look more professional than
the condemned, clearly but all their vehicles should still be pretty worn down (showing the signs of a defective
state). The Syndicate of course will have an ivory tower vibe"*). Wear and polish tell each faction's story, and
make them readable at a glance:

| Faction | Condition | Concept-art cues |
|---|---|---|
| **The Condemned** | Scrap welded by prisoners | Rust, grime, raw weld seams, cage mesh, faded prison stencils and inmate numbers, hazard paint |
| **Road gangs** | Rusted but *loved* | Rust and dust with polished chrome engines, hand-painted flames and skulls, trophies bolted on: pride in their machines |
| **The Law** | Institutional, **neglected** | A uniform livery that is clearly an organization, but faded and peeling; mismatched replacement panels in primer; rust at the seams; dented, patched armor; a light bar with dead bulbs and a cracked lens; retrofitted cyberpunk gear zip-tied onto old hulls; faded unit numbers and "PROPERTY OF" stencils. Professional design, failing upkeep |
| **The Syndicate** | **Immaculate**, the ivory tower | Spotless even in the grime of the arena; seamless curved panels, pearl and ivory finishes with black glass and thin gold or cyan trim, discreet luxury logos, no visible fasteners or wear; the only faction that looks brand new. Their contrast with the arena is the point |

**Rendering crews cheaply:** oversized "miniature scale" riders baked into the vehicle model, shader sway or a few
rigid moving parts (no skeletons), detail saved for close-ups (army builder, kill-cams, victory), and the same
cheap figure tech as the arena crowds.

## Army, squads, budget

- **Before the round:** a budget, **buy any mix of units, and divide them into up to 5 squads** **(lead)**.
  Squads hold up to 5 units (formations place 5) **(proposed)**. Army size is limited by budget.
- **Squads are the unit of command.** The player commands one squad at a time and **switches squads with one tap**
  (a squad bar) **(lead)**.
- **Cosmetic paint** stays optional and free (never sold). Team identity comes from accent lights.

## Progression: credits earn more options

- **Winning earns credits** **(lead)**. Credits unlock **new unit types** and **higher budget tiers** (bigger armies).
- **Fairness guard (proposed; important for die-hard players):** matches are fought at a **shared budget tier**.
  Both sides get the same budget, so a veteran's bigger bank never buys a bigger army against a newcomer. Unlocks
  add *options*, not raw power: units are sidegrades by design (counters, not upgrades). Losing still earns a
  little. Competitive/ranked play (later) uses fixed budgets and the full roster.
- **No money in the loop**, ever (pillar 1).
- Progress is saved locally first (`user://`); an account system comes with online play (netcode, later).

## Commanding (mobile first)

- **Tap a squad** (its chip in the squad bar, or any of its units on the map) → **tap the ground or the radar**
  → it goes there **(lead)**. No right-click. Advanced (optional): hold-and-drag to set facing.
- **Formations get icons** that show the shape, drawn from the real formation geometry, so a non-military
  player sees what "wedge" or "echelon right" means **(lead)**. Drills (move, bound, hold, assault, break
  contact) get icons and one-line plain-language descriptions too.
- **The camera follows the action** **(lead)**: after an order to somewhere off screen, the camera smoothly tracks
  the squad (or frames squad + destination) instead of making the player zoom out and back in. Manual pan
  always overrides; a tap on the squad bar re-centers.
- Commands stay **SquadCommand data** ([tactical_map.md](tactical_map.md)), so the CPU, Claude, and a future LLM
  commander use the same verbs as the player.

## Unit AI: really good, before any LLM

The lead wants this *"really sophisticated"*. The player's orders set intent; each vehicle's brain does the rest:
- **Cover:** find positions that block line of sight to known threats, reach them, **peek out to shoot and duck
  back** (fire from cover, reload in cover), and prefer hull-down angles that show front armor.
- **Target selection by matchup:** engage what my weapon is good against; avoid duels I lose; call for help.
- **Friendly fire awareness:** never take a shot whose line of fire (or splash) crosses a friendly, or weigh the
  risk explicitly; move to clear a firing lane.
- **Squad tactics:** bounding overwatch, suppress-and-flank, focus fire, covering a retreating teammate,
  protecting fragile units (artillery, Lancers).
- **Deterministic, measurable:** pure decision functions, seeded; behavior regression scenarios ("peeks from
  cover", "holds fire when a friendly crosses") plus AI-vs-AI tournaments with ELO so a new brain must beat the old one.
- Grounding in game-AI literature: utility AI (what we have), tactical position evaluation (Killzone,
  CryEngine's Tactical Point System, Unreal's EQS), influence maps, and GOAP-style squad coordination (F.E.A.R.).
  Details belong in the AI stream's design doc.

## The arena

- A **gladiator arena** in a converted industrial site, with **stands full of cheering crowds** that react to the
  fight (big kills, close calls) **(lead)**.
- **Textured ground** and **better lighting**: readable at night without losing the neon mood **(lead)**.
- **Map layouts (proposed): authored, symmetric arenas as data, not a full procedural generator yet.**
  Competitive fairness needs point symmetry and curated cover, which generators struggle to guarantee. A small set of hand-made
  layouts (cover, lanes, chokepoints) plus optional seeded variation of dressing is the right first step; revisit a
  generator once we know what makes a good layout. The lead was unsure whether a generator is worth it; this is the recommendation.
- Unit art and arena art come from the Meshy pipeline, **with the lead approving concept images before any
  image-to-3D request** **(lead)**.

## Match rules (current defaults)

- Squad-vs-squad elimination; no respawns.
- **Friendly fire on** **(lead)**.
- The center **control point** as a second win condition: round 1 measured that it restores "coordination
  beats individuals" under shields (balance.md). **Recommended default; pending the lead.**
- Fog of war from per-unit sight; scouting matters.

## Later layers (kept, not now)

- Online play: the relay broker and player-hosted matches exist (archive/round1/netcode.md); lockstep for ranked is
  feasible (integer core spike). Resumes after the core loop is fun.
- **The AI Commander:** an optional LLM opponent that issues the same SquadCommands. Bring-your-own Gemini key
  first, then on-device Gemini Nano on Android (the plan and its rules are in vision.md).
- Replays and spectating (recording works over the relay today).
